# Wells Fargo Pricing Data

## Description of data

The attached data file (skills_test.csv) contains text data pertaining to Wells
Fargo, a US bank. This data includes documents sourced from a variety of 
platforms including Twitter, Facebook, blogs and forums.

There are two columns in the data file. `Text` contains exactly that. `label`
contains a binary label indicating whether the document is about `pricing` (1)
or not (0).

## Description of tasks

You have two tasks:
1) classify documents based on whether or not they discuss pricing
2) summarise the dataset

These tasks give us insight into your technical and methodological knowledge
as well as your curiosity, creativity and ability to pick up new methods 
quickly. Good luck!

#### Task 1: classification

Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to correctly classify the 
documents into classes 0 and 1.

It is worth trying not only a variety of classification algorithms (SVM,
RandomForest, NaiveBayes, Neural Net etc.) but also a variety of 
tokenization approaches!

We want to see a summary of the techniques you tried and the results you 
received. We're interested in how you quantify the results of the various 
techniques that you try too please so don't forget to report that. The F1 
score (harmonic mean) is a good option here.

#### Task 2: describe & summarise

We are also interested in your ability to make sense of the data. Please 
tell us what's in this dataset? Here are some areas that you might consider 
looking into to get you started: frequent terms, topics, users, sentiment, 
etc. 

Be creative and have fun!

Live long and prosper ðŸ––
