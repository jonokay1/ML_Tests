"This fall, Seattle curtailed its business with Wells Fargo, though it stopped short of full divestment. In October, the city voted to pull out of an upcoming contract to have Wells Fargo manage a $100 million bond financing for Seattle City Light, the public utility that provides the city’s electricity. This decision was driven not by the company’s connection to the fossil fuel industry, but rather the discovery that Wells Fargo employees had been opening fraudulent accounts and saddling customers with bogus fees. Saying in a letter that the city “expected far better from its business partners,” Mayor Ed Murray, Council President Bruce Harrell, and Finance and Budget Committee Chair Tim Burgess vowed that the city would not recommence doing business with Wells Fargo until the bank provided details on how it plans to fix the problems it has created.“ Your organization’s underhanded practices greatly harm not only the customers who have been shouldered with bogus fees and unfairly reduced credit scores through no fault of their own, but also your own reputation and relationship with your institutional customers, including the City of Seattle,” the letter stated.“",1

"Pimco Sues Wells Fargo, Claims MBS Trustee ‘Looted’ Trusts to Pay Legal Fees Pimco’s lawyers at Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann allege that Wells Fargo has improperly reserved about $95 million across 20 MBS trusts. Reuters | Jul 13, 2017 By Alison Frankel (Reuters) - Several Pimco investment funds are accusing the mortgage-backed securities trustee Wells Fargo of misusing noteholder money to pay its own legal expenses. In a newly filed complaint in Manhattan State Supreme Court, the Pimco funds are asking for a declaratory judgment that Wells Fargo is not entitled to use MBS trust money to fund its defense against noteholder claims that the bank breached its duties as an MBS trustee. Pimco’s lawyers at Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann allege that Wells Fargo has improperly reserved about $95 million across 20 MBS trusts. The Pimco complaint is the latest wrinkle in increasingly complex litigation between MBS noteholders and trustees.",1
"Try to use one attached to a bank during business hours in case the machine eats the card (has not happened to us). We take two ATM's linked to different checking accounts in case one is lost or hacked. We bank with Wells Fargo and yes, there is a charge. We might do better with an ATM linked to a credit union or such, but our banking relationship saves us more in the long run than the ATM fees. We always take some currency, anywhere from 100-200 Euros.",1

"I've got two checking/savings account setups and they're with two different credit unions. Their fees are generally smaller (e.g. insufficient funds is $25 with my credit union and the last I knew that was around $37.50 with Wells Fargo) and easier to have removed upon request (depending on the situation), and personally I've not seen them in headlines about large-scale credit card account and mortgage fraud like I have Wells Fargo. I started with a Wells Fargo account and one with a credit union, and I dropped Wells Fargo a few years ago and switched to the second credit union.",1

"But as early as 2010, before the CFPB was set up, regulators at the OCC were increasingly aware of what was happening at Wells Fargo thanks to hundreds of whistleblower complaints. The OCC even confronted the bank, yet failed to take any action despite many red flags, according to an internal audit. It wasn’t until the Los Angeles city attorney and the CFPB became involved years later that Wells Fargo took forceful action to stop the fraud. The regulators fined Wells Fargo a total of $185 million and forced it to refund fees it had charged customers and hire an independent consultant to review its procedures. More importantly, they sent a clear message to other financial institutions: Cheat consumers and you will face the consequences.",1

"Yes, I agree, context is important. Let's add some to your chart too. That big dip back in April-May 2017 happened because Tether/BitFinex lost their fiat banking -- first Wells Fargo blocked all their US wire routing, followed by their Taiwanese bank dropping them when it discovered Tether/iFinex had misrepresented their business so they could open their account in the first place. In fact, Kraken added their USD/USDT pair right when BFX lost the ability to convert Tethers to and from USD, giving traders a chance to bail out of USDT and resulting in the substantial price depression at the end of April Since April 18, 2017, all incoming international wires to Tether have been blocked and refused by our Taiwanese banks.

When news broke of the scandal I realized what had actually happened. I called the Wells Fargo complaint line and went into mediation with them, requested $5000 for the inconvenience (I did not pay any fees or anything since I closed the card immediately but wanted to see what I could get), they countered with $500, and I requested $1000 and got it. I made one of the terms of the mediation settlement that the inquiry on my credit report be removed as well. Just a heads up if you’re like me and had an unauthorized account opened - even if you did not suffer any tangible monetary losses from their fraud you can still be eligible for a decent-sized payout!",1
"Monday’s lawsuit accuses the bank of violating numerous state and federal consumer protection laws, including the U.S. Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the U.S. Truth in Lending Act. A spokesman for Wells Fargo could not immediately be reached for comment.

In a securities filing, the bank said it was working with regulators to see if customers had been harmed by the fees. Interest rate locks are guarantees by a lender to lock in a set interest rate, usually for several weeks, while a loan is being processed.",1

The lecture-by-bullhorn went (loosely), like this: When the economy was booming and many people wanted to buy homes, banks realized they could profit from this surge and offered people houses that were more expensive than they could afford. People were lured in by predatory loans with deceptively low interest rates. Then the banks packaged these mortgages together and sold them to investors who took advantage of the booming market until the bubble burst and home prices began to fall, when many people started to default on the predatory mortgages.",1

"After paying attorneys’ fees, the $110 million will first go to cover any customers’ out-of-pocket losses or fees that they may have incurred due to the unauthorized accounts. All remaining money will be split among the all impacted customers. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo has seen sharp declines in new account openings and bank traffic, and has been working to restore customers’ trust since the practices came to light. The biggest scandal in the bank’s history led to the abrupt retirement of its CEO, John Stumpf. In response to the scandal, Wells has changed its sales practices, ousted other executives and called tens of millions of customers to check on whether they truly opened the accounts in question.",1
"Wells Fargo’s shares were flat on Monday, closing at $55.04, giving the firm a market value of just over $275 billion. It’s spent much of the past year trying to emerge from a scandal over employees creating fake accounts to meet sales goals, a debacle that’s cost the bank millions of dollars in legal fees and its former chief executive officer his job. Wells Fargo executives are expected to update analysts and shareholders on their strategy at an investor day scheduled for Thursday. They will probably highlight efforts to focus on customer service rather than product sales, and emphasize the strength of the bank’s economic model, Eric Wasserstrom, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, said in a note to investors Tuesday. “The one incremental action that we expect is for WFC to announce additional cost reductions,” he wrote, using the bank’s ticker symbol.",1
"“This agreement is another step in our journey to make things right with customers,” Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan said in a prepared statement. Sloan took over as CEO in October. Wells Fargo’s board of directors is conducting an investigation into the bank’s sales practices, a report that is expected to be out in April ahead of the annual shareholder meeting. The board has already cut bonuses to major executives. The downgrade Tuesday from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the nation’s supervisor for all large national banks, moved Wells Fargo to a “needs to improve” standing from its previous “outstanding” under the Community Reinvestment Act.",1
"I use that just to have a little cash when I land. You can't always be certain that a given machine or location can take your US no-chip credit cards or that your credit card company or bank won't flag the transaction, so it is nice to have some just in case to get a taxi, metro tickets, bite to eat, etc. Also, once I was so jet-lagged I could not recall my pin number! I also use Wells Fargo to get money in advance. They charge about five percent above the ""spot"" rate. When you calculate the rates, this is about what you will pay using a standard ATM card with a foreign transaction fee.",1

Bitfinex tried to sway Wells Fargo, but Wells Fargo pointed out that Bitfinex was not their customer. The BFX token “redemption” was only a number in the user’s USD account on Bitfinex, and could not be withdrawn – 3 and 4 April 2017 were bank holidays in Taiwan, so nobody could have got their US dollars out between Bitfinex’s announcement and Wells Fargo cutting them off.

Wells Fargo used to have this product and I don't know if they still do but it was called direct deposit advance. Basically in your personal account it would average out your direct deposits and let you advance future direct deposits after a certain time.. it was basically a somewhat cheaper payday loan and you can only take them a certain amount of consecutive times before you had to wait to take another one. It was cheaper than doing overdraft protection if you did it soon enough and an overdraft protection transfer from another account with something like 12:50. The reason I bring this up is I used to be a telephone Banker for Wells Fargo and I saw some very very messed up accounts and what this product and overdraft protection can do based on how they process debits and credits.,1

For example, if you got paid on Monday and deposited your pay that day then subsequently made a purchase the following Tuesday night, even though you put the money in and gave enough time for the account to update, the banks would still run the charge(s) first before they would update your balance.

"However, his biggest goal of selling the company’s gastrointestinal unit Salix to Japan’s Takeda was not reached after a disagreement over price, one person said on Tuesday. There were mixed reactions to Ackman’s exit. “With … one of its most vocal supporters selling its stake near the low for the past 10 years, we see this as a vote of no confidence for the stock and that things are continuing to go from bad to worse for Valeant,” said Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who rates the stock an underperform. But one investor in Ackman’s fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, said his departure could give management more room to act and eventually pave the way for other investors to step back in. Ackman’s concentrated bets and brash declarations – he once said Valeant would hit $448 a share by 2019 – have made him a polarizing figure on Wall Street with some investors keen to take the opposing view from him.",1
"The danger from clients being turned away is that it provides an opportunity for competitors such as JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup. U.S. banks already expect revenues to climb and the profitability of their lending to rise this year due to lower corporate tax rates and higher interest rates. Wells Fargo’s balance sheet expanded steadily from the end of 2013 to 2016, but growth slowed dramatically last year as it battled to address the issues raised by the scandal. “The growth limits will force Wells Fargo to slow down and that leaves room for others to pick up market share,” said Michael Kon, portfolio manager and director of research at San Mateo-based Golub Group, which sold its stake in Wells Fargo, once around 400,000 shares, as the sales problems emerged. “It will take a bigger decline in the price of WFC to get us interested again.",1

"Is Wells Fargo effectively a beneficiary of that old adage that “bad publicity is better than no publicity at all?” A column by Seeking Alpha posited that the firm will benefit from Donald Trump’s presidency, with a tailwind enjoyed by his domestic spending agenda.

The company has lost some business, including with Bay Area Air Quality Management, and there has been no lasting loss of depositors.",1

They raised our interest rate to 21%, demanded $34,000 in back payments, back interest, and legal fees, and on top of that demanded another $27,400 downpayment.

Grant Govertsen of Union Gaming Securities Asia Ltd, noted April’s growth was better than consensus estimates, and was the “third straight month” this had happened. Recent market growth had been driven by “Chinese monetary stimulus and the reinflation of the Chinese housing bubble; influences we think won’t drive prolonged, above-trend growth,” said Cameron McKnight of Wells Fargo Securities LLC. The institution expects May casino GGR to expand by 14 percent to 18 percent year-on-year. Mr Jones at Buckingham Research estimated May’s growth would be 13 percent to 15 percent. “The average sequential increase from April to May has been 5 percent over the last 11 years, with the only sequential decline in 2006,” he stated.",1

"Patricia McCoy, a former CFPB mortgage official, said the disclosure about the mortgage rate fees fits a pattern. “Wells Fargo had a business model, until all of this came to light, that emphasized generating fees charged to consumers under duplicitous circumstances simply for the sake of padding revenue,” said McCoy, who is now a professor at Boston College Law School. Testifying before the Senate on Tuesday, Wells Fargo’s CEO insisted that the bank has made fundamental changes to fix its broken culture. “The past year has been humbling and challenging,” Sloan said. “We are resolving past problems even as we make changes to ensure nothing like this happens again at Wells Fargo.”",1

"Employees went to far as to create phony PIN numbers and fake email addresses to enroll customers in online banking services, the CFPB said. The scope of the scandal is shocking. An analysis conducted by a consulting firm hired by Wells Fargo concluded that bank employees opened up over 1.5 million deposit accounts that may not have been authorized, according to the CFPB. The way it worked was that employees moved funds from customers' existing accounts into newly-created accounts without their knowledge or consent, regulators say. The CFPB described this practice as ""widespread"" and led to customers being charged for insufficient funds or overdraft fees -- because the money was not in their original accounts.",1

"Wells Fargo benefits from this because there are fees associated with just maintaining the account or credit card. But it probably didn't make much money from that, relative to its income, because those fees are small and a large percentage would have been refunded. The reason the accounts were made is that Wells Fargo evaluated employees based solely on the number of new accounts opened per month. If you failed to meet your monthly quota you were fired, if you exceeded it you were given bonuses or promoted. So they basically created a system that provided a very minimal benefit to the company as a whole and created an extremely toxic working environment while being a tremendous detriment to their customers.",1

Back in '04 when I started my first checking account with Wells Fargo I was charged a maintenance fee on my account because it was below a certain dollar amount, which overdrew me so they charged me an overdraft fee. But because I was already over drawn, they hit me with another overdraft fee. The best part? When I closed my account in '05, I had a zero balance.",1

Days later, the board’s risk committee first learned of mass firings, according to the report.

"America's three biggest banks -- JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) -- earned more than $6.4 billion last year from ATM and overdraft fees, according to an analysis by CNNMoney that was verified by S&P Global Market Intelligence. That works out to over $25 in fees annually for every adult American. Despite public outcry, banks show no sign of scaling back on fees.",1
"Wells Fargo only refunded what the bank charged them for overdrawing their accounts and bounced payments.. . What about late payment fees and interest from others like utilities for late payment, They may have had other credit cards that charged them late payment fees and interest as well. This was fraud at the corporate level and the execs should go to jail for it.",1
"WASHINGTON — The nation’s banks and credit card lenders won the right to duck big lawsuits when groups of customers accuse them of cheating, with a Senate vote Tuesday night letting lenders force customers into arbitration instead. The vote, mirroring a similar one in the House this summer, will void a federal rule that created a hard-won right for borrowers: the right to band together and sue lenders over disputed fees or abusive credit practices. Consumer groups and Richard Cordray, who helped create the rule as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, said Tuesday night’s Senate vote and President Donald Trump’s promised signing of the bill marked a bitter defeat for consumers — and a victory for financial predators such as Wells Fargo and Equifax. It represented “a savage attack on American consumers,” said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a public interest group. The CFPB’s arbitration rule is overturned by the Senate.",1
"The harm also included repossession costs, late fees, charges for insufficient funds and damage to consumers’ credit reports. In other words, Wells has just opened itself to mass, and open-ended litigation which could run well into the billions. The mechanics of the fraud: Here is how the process worked: When customers financed cars with Wells Fargo, the buyers’ information would go to National General, which was supposed to check a database to see if the owner had insurance coverage. If not, the insurer would automatically impose coverage on the customers’ accounts, adding an extra layer of premiums and interest to their loans. When customers who checked their bills saw the charges and notified Wells Fargo that they already had car insurance, the bank was supposed to cancel the insurance and credit the borrower with the amount that had been charged.",1

SOURCE:http://www.pymnts.com/news/banking/2016/more-accusations-against-wells-fargo/
This year hasn’t been the best for banking and financial services company Wells Fargo. Earlier this year, news broke that federal prosecutors were investigating the as many as 2 million sham customer accounts Wells Fargo admitted holding, which led to a $185 million fine levied on the banking giant. A few months, a new CEO and a meeting with Congress later, it has come to light that Wells Fargo employees may have signed up bank customers for partner Prudential’s insurance policy without customer knowledge or permission. In some cases, Wells Fargo employees reportedly arranged for monthly premium fees to be withdrawn from customer accounts. Evidence in a wrongful termination lawsuit levied at Prudential by three whistleblowers suggests that Wells Fargo employees were encouraged to direct clients to sign up for the MyTerm insurance policy — employees received credit on quarterly sales quotas if they signed up new customers.",1
"Date Posted: 7 minutes ago #1 Advertisement Former Wells Fargo Chairman and CEO John Stumpf sold $61 million worth of Wells Fargo ( WFC ) shares in the month prior to settling a long-running investigation that charged the bank with falsifying millions of customer accounts to boost sales and fees. The following month, when regulators announced on Sept. 8 that they’d fined Wells Fargo $185 million for falsifying more than 2 million customer accounts to meet aggressive sales goals, the company’s stock price plunged and Stumpf was called on the carpet before Congress before finally resigning this week. Stumpf pocketed $26 million in proceeds from that August sale -- the shares in question were “incentive stock options” purchased at a discount to Wells Fargo’s current market price and then immediately sold at a profit -- reflecting a small piece of the rich incentive pay that Stumpf collected during his tenure at the top of the bank.",1

Wells Fargo expects short term profit hit from interest rates rise -CEO ift.tt/2hcYZ4z,1
"Adjusting value for a 2 percent increase in interest rate (to 6.45% discount rate) in the near term future the NPV at 30 years is $1,171 ($1,180 for 20 years). The low price on Friday was 1192. At the current price the preferred is offering a two percent premium over the bonds for taking the risk of being lower in the claim of assets of Wells Fargo (45 percent more income). However I think this past week has actually lowered the risk of that type of event. So while the risk of interest rates rising are greater than a year ago, the value of WFCPL is compensating well for this risk in my mind.",1
"They're stingy with their limits, their interest rates are nothing special, and even banks I have had absolutely no prior contact with at all have been more eager to extend credit to me than Wells Fargo where I've had accounts in good standing for years. Literally I've asked Wells Fargo for credit and Yes, it's convenient to have a credit card with the same institution that holds your checking and savings accounts. I've done that, and yes it's nice. But Wells Fargo's billpay system is perfectly decent, and it's just not that much of a hassle to use it to electronically pay credit cards held by other banks. Though note that their online system was recently ""dumbed down"" and it isn't as good as it used to be.",1
"/u/dominant_driver on CEO sold millions in Wells Fargo stock before fraud revelations The fees are only for people with less than $1.5k in their accounts, so rich people don't have to worry about them.",1
"Wells Fargo must refund all affected consumers the sum of all monthly maintenance fees, nonsufficient fund fees, overdraft charges, and other fees they paid because of the creation of the unauthorized accounts. These refunds are expected to total at least $2.5 million. Consumers are not required to take any action to get refunds to which they are entitled.",1
"Followup: To recap: Wells Fargo used two of their automatic bill pay systems to simultaneously charge my bank account for a Credit Card payment over the weekend. The actual charges didn't hit my account until today. When they did, my checking and savings accounts dropped into negative numbers, and had to be caught (thankfully) by their Overdraft Protection system. I didn't become aware of this until a few hours later. I called WF, and got an ""executive Customer Care"" specialist on the line.",1
"No surprise, then, that in 2014, Bank of America, was fined more than $700 million by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for selling add-on products to credit cards. And before the Wells Fargo scandal hit the front pages, the CFPB investigated overdraft fees, which account for billions in revenue for the big banks. A recent analysis of CFPB complaints data shows that complaints against Wells Fargo are actually lower than the number filed against Citigroup or Bank of America. While bank executives pass the buck, and regulators and lawmakers investigate these common industry practices after the fact, workers could be our most important allies in knowing in real time what the big banks are up to. When we partnered with the Committee for Better Banks last June to interview frontline workers for our report, Banking on the Hard Sell, we heard from tellers, call center workers, customer service workers, and branch managers employed by seven banks around the country.",1
"Wells Fargo needs to go. They are scum. Took my deposit, then removed it, processed payments, then put deposit back in so I would show overdrafts.",1
"Almost everywhere in the US there are credit unions with less fees than BoA, Wells Fargo, Chase etc. And more often than not they offer drastically better service. I bank through Wells Fargo for business and they are a fucking expensive pain but they facilitate large and international transactions better. My credit union charges ZERO fees for checking, savings, and full atm fee reimbursement from 90%+ of atms(just not the free standing ones in bodegas and in night clubs that charge $5.00)",1
"Several banks allow this, including BoA, Wells Fargo, and US Bank - and I'm sure others as well, but I'm unsure of the fees. Sometimes they'll waive the fee if it's super low, but that's a lot of effort to go through for MS. Also, I think they require that you use a credit card that is through that bank as well.",1
"I've never dealt with Wells Fargo since. I will say though. I have USBank, and I denied the overdraft thing, so when my account gets to 0 (which has only happened once because I forgot to transfer money) it just denies the charges.",1

"On April 13th, 2017 Bitfinex announced that its outbound USD wire transfers were experiencing significant delays. Bitfinex stated that the delays were the product of Wells Fargo refusing to continue servicing the wire operations that the exchange relies on to transfer US funds to their customers. In a lawsuit filed by Bitfinex on April 5th (since withdrawn), Bitfinex (the plaintiff) stated: “Wells Fargo has suspended U.S. dollar wire transfer operations needed to remit to plaintiffs’ customers U.S. dollars that the customers deposited with plaintiffs to purchase digital currency, causing imminent and irreparable harm to plaintiffs.” While Bitfinex is not a direct customer of the bank, Wells Fargo is an intermediary in the banking network used by the exchange. By refusing to service USD wire transfers originating from Bitfinex, Wells Fargo has excluded them from a large part of the global banking apparatus and from accessing the largest economy in the world.",1

"""In April, regulators announced that they had rejected the “living will” plans proposed by Wells Fargo and four other major banks.

"Gary Johnson wants to grant more power and authority to the big Wall Street banks. In an era when banks that are “too big to fail” are known to fail, when we’ve watched the entire economy collapse at the hands of a predatory financial market, Johnson wants to repeal every regulation against such reckless behavior. He wants to repeal Dodd-Frank, the law that is currently ensuring that Wells Fargo doesn’t go entirely without consequence for inventing millions of phony bank accounts and charging customers the fees for them. While Gary Johnson often gets lambasted by Libertarians for not being a “true” Libertarian himself, when it comes to the financial sector of our economy, he’s as true as it gets — which means no protections against monopolies, no protections against fraud, no protections for people from their banks at all. But this isn’t the only way Johnson doesn’t feel the need as a president to protect the people he represents.",1

Payments are applied to the account as of the day you make it (for late fees, delinquencies, etc), but often times a float is placed on a payment, where the credit doesn't become available until the float expires.

"Tomorrow the U.S. Senate Banking Committee will hold a hearing to take testimony from Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf and Federal regulators to understand how this mega bank was able to get away with opening more than two million fake customer accounts over a span of years. The accounts and/or credit cards were never authorized by the customer and were opened solely by employees to meet sales quotas, get bonuses or to avoid getting fired for failing to meet sales targets. The only reason the Republican-controlled Senate is holding this hearing is because the Wells Fargo fake-account story got a lot of coverage in the media when the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)announced a $185 million settlement over the charges on September 8. The reason the story got a lot of media coverage is because it’s a simple story to tell: widely respected bank opens two million accounts for its customers without their knowledge or permission, sometimes illegally funneling money to the new account from the old account to generate fees. In July of last year, when Citibank, the deposit-taking retail bank settled charges with the CFPB for $700 million for deceptively selling add-on products to credit card customers, the Senate Banking Committee yawned and did nothing.",1

This year “will be a tale of two halves,” with the first featuring strong corporate earnings growth and a healthy merger-and-acquisition cycle, and the second “heavily influenced by the Fed tightening cycle.” >The increase in the target was partially due to Wells Fargo’s increase in annual earnings-per-share projections to $150.76 from $146.01, the analysts said, and also to a reduction in the risk premium to 150 basis points from 165 basis points as the Cboe Volatility Index spiked and interest rates rose.

"Wells Fargo account fraud scandal The Wells Fargo account fraud scandal is an ongoing controversy brought about by the creation of millions of fraudulent savings and checking accounts on behalf of Wells Fargo clients without their consent. Various regulatory bodies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), fined the company a combined $185 million as a result of the illegal activity, and the company faces additional civil and criminal suits. Wells Fargo clients began to notice the fraud after being charged unanticipated fees and receiving unexpected credit or debit cards or lines of credit. Initial reports blamed individual Wells Fargo branch workers and managers for the problem, as well as sales incentives associated with selling multiple ""solutions"" or financial products.

Between April and July, 2016 alone it had revenues of $22.16 billion. Why should we expect Wells Fargo or any other big bank to stop such frauds, when they’re so lucrative?

"John Raoux/AP In a scandal that extended wider than was previously known, Wells Fargo said it would offer refunds to tens of thousands of customers who were improperly charged fees on home mortgages.

Current and former employees said at the time that the practice was especially prevalent in the Los Angeles area and Oregon.",1
"Wells Fargo has two services - ""overdraft protection"" and ""debit card overdraft service"", and they're not mutually exclusive. You can turn off the debit card overdraft service, and your debit card purchases will be declined if you don't have enough in your account (sans automatic payments like Netflix). At the same time, you can still turn overdraft protection on, which allows the bank to pull money from savings if you don't have enough money in checking when a check is processed or a recurring debit card transaction is made.",1

"Media: MoneyTime Along with the sales-practices issue, Wells Fargo is under investigation for forcing auto insurance policies onto roughly 800,000 auto loan customers who may have already had insurance elsewhere. In several thousand of cases, the additional cost of the insurance made the car loan payment unaffordable and those vehicles were eventually repossessed. And last year Wells Fargo had to offer refunds to customers after acknowledging that its mortgage bankers unfairly charged them fees to lock in interest rates on mortgages. The bank is also under investigation for possibly overcharging corporate customers foreign transaction fees. Wells Fargo justified Sloan's overall pay package in its proxy by saying that it reflected ""solid financial performance.""",1
"National General, an insurance company, has monitored the “force-placed” coverage for Wells Fargo since 2015, the bank has said. Previously, the program was run by companies including QBE Insurance Group Ltd, Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and defunct Countrywide Financial. In 2014, Wells Fargo agreed to pay mortgage borrowers who were wrongly pushed into extra flood and wind protection. QBE Insurance managed the bank’s force-placed insurance program at the time and was part of the settlement. Reporting By Patrick Rucker; Editing by Lauren Tara LaCapra and Clive McKeef",1

The specific issues under investigation and allegedly disclosed to Wells Fargo remain confidential.

"The bank is also under investigation for possibly overcharging corporate customers foreign transaction fees. Wells Fargo justified Sloan’s overall pay package in its proxy by saying that it reflected “solid financial performance.” But the bank did not substantially grow profits last year which would typically be a reason for such a pay increase. Net income at the bank last year was $22.2 billion, up from $21.9 billion in 2016, an increase of little more than 1 percent.

"When a firm is temporarily beyond the pale in the press cycle, as Wells Fargo is at the moment, to defend them to any degree at all puts the speaker and everyone associated (Mr Munger and Berkshire) in a very bad light.

If Mr Munger is saying good things about Wells Fargo, then Mr Munger and everybody associated with him are just more criminals.

"We have an excellent idea of what corporations could do with such a gift: like Wells Fargo, they might try and make it virtually impossible for customers to prevent small-time rip-offs and change their shady behavior. And that could serve to just enable petty theft.

We don't know whether any of those fees were illegally gained, and if Wells Fargo has its way, we never will.

"The claims, made in a lawsuit filed in 2006 by Georgia mortgage brokers Victor Bibby and Brian Donnelly and made public in 2011, said the bank charged veterans hidden fees when refinancing mortgages and hid the fees when veterans applied for federal loan guarantees. The mortgage brokers received settlements from eight other lenders for similar losses including Bank of America, Citigroup Inc. and JP Morgan Chase & Co.

However, the eight other lenders settled for a combined $161.7 million, making Wells Fargo's settlement the largest, according to Reuters. “More than six years ago, when questions about fees on Veterans Administration refinance loans were raised, we resolved those concerns by improving our internal controls and made compensation available to VA customers who closed a refinance before that time,” Tim Sloan, Wells Fargo’s chief executive officer, said in a statement Friday. “Settling this longstanding lawsuit allows us to put the matter behind us and continue to focus on serving customers and rebuilding trust with our stakeholders. We are committed to serving the financial health and well-being of veterans, and we will continue to honor that commitment now and in the future.”",1

"So if a cardholder with $100 in their account made successive withdrawals of $20, $30, and $110 over the course of a day, instead of getting hit with one $35 overdraft fee, Wells Fargo would reorder the transactions from high to low, thus earning three fees. The plaintiffs won a $203 million judgment in 2010. But in an appeal before the 9th Circuit in 2012, Wells’ lawyers argued that a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2011, AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion, gave Wells Fargo the right to compel arbitration and quash the case, even after the judgment was rendered. The 9th Circuit ruled that Wells Fargo never requested or even mentioned arbitration for five years of litigating the case.

"Because closing costs depend on fees beyond the bank’s control, we looked only at bank fees like underwriting and processing that are paid as part of closing costs. The agents we spoke to said bank fees vary by state. Wells Fargo’s fees fall at or below average for the mortgage lenders in the industry. Eligibility & Requirements Like most mortgage loan companies, Wells Fargo requires a five percent down payment, although it may allow a lower down payment for first-time homebuyers with excellent credit.",1

"On the other side of this struggle are American people who cannot afford pay for insurance services and often avoid seeking medical help until it is absolutely necessary. Although current solution proposed by the Republican’s party is to incentivize people to get medical insurance in exchange for a tax credit, I believe the solution to the damaged health insurance system will come first with re-negotiation of insurance costs in order to make medical services closer to the cost that medical providers charge. How is it even possible that Wells Fargo is capable of offering insurance services to UC students under Anthem BlueCross insurance plan with low or even zero deductibles for less than $200 a month, while the same plan directly costs over $600 per person? So, I believe that incentives to people to purchase insurance should start with establishing a reasonable and affordable price to get access to the fundamental services of health care. Therefore, policymakers should reevaluate the existing health care system because it does not benefit the society in general.",1

Plaintiffs alleged that although their mortgage agreements allowed Wells Fargo to pass along the costs of obtaining these appraisals from third-party real estate brokers, the bank charged homeowners more than it paid for the appraisals.

"Potential Lawsuit: Wells Fargo Excessive Overdraft Fees Legal News & Lawsuit Information Wells Fargo Bank and other financial institutions have faced allegations that they used deceptive practices in charging customers excessive overdraft fees. Federal rules that took effect in 2010 no longer allow banks and credit unions to charge overdraft fees on ATM or debit card transactions unless the bank customer agrees to “opt-in” to overdraft protection. However, banks and credit unions are still allowed to charge when checks or certain recurring electronic payments overdraw an account, even when the customer didn’t opt-in to overdraft protection.",1

You would even have what were called ""mis-session reviews"" meaning if someone came in to so much as get a replacement debit card (!) you would have to stop in the middle of the ""session"" (interaction) to go speak to a manager so they could make SURE you were offering some kind of ""solution"" (product) to the customer.

"The Wells Fargo class action lawsuit was filed last month in California Superior Court in Los Angeles by two former employees, Alexander Polonsky and Brian Zaghi. The complaint (PDF) seeks to represent both past and current employees who followed financial laws but were penalized by the company for failing to meet sales quotas. In September, a massive Wells Fargo Bank fraud was revealed, when it was announced that the bank will pay $185 million in fines to the federal government, and return about $2 million in fees to customers who had fake accounts and credit cards set up in their names. More than two million such ghost accounts and credit cards were made without the knowledge or permission of the customers, who were often then hit with fees and charges for accounts they did not want or know they had. The fraudulent Wells Fargo accounts were reportedly established in response to a bonus structure at the bank, which was encouraged by sales targets and compensation incentives based on new account activity.",1

It was fined $1.2 billion earlier this year for foreclosure fraud.

"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) – Wells Fargo & Co detailed new regulatory restrictions imposed by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Friday that sent its shares down sharply in after-hours trading, as the third-largest U.S. bank continues to reel from a sales scandal that erupted in 2016. Wells is not allowed to grow beyond the $1.95 trillion in assets it had at the end of last year “until it sufficiently improves its governance and controls,” the Fed said in a statement. Wells Fargo estimated that the cap will cut its annual profit by $300 million to $400 million this year, as it reduces some parts of its balance sheet, like corporate deposits and trading assets, in order to continue growing core businesses. That represents 1.5 to 1.9 percent of the profit Wells generated in 2017. The bank will also replace three board members by April and a fourth board member by the end of the year, the Fed said, without naming who they should be.",1

"In his lawsuit, former banker Mauricio Alaniz alleged that Wells Fargo’s mortgage-processing and underwriting division was understaffed, leading to chronic delays that were not borrowers’ fault. But rather than have the bank waive the rate-lock fee, workers would falsely report that borrowers had submitted incomplete or inaccurate information, according to the lawsuit. Wells Fargo is by far the nation’s largest mortgage lender, originating $244 billion in home loans last year, or about 12 percent of all U.S. mortgages. Bank spokesman Tom Goyda said that he could not comment on Alaniz’s lawsuit but that the bank is reviewing “questions that have been raised about past practices” related to rate-lock fees. Alaniz’s complaint mirrors claims made by another former Wells Fargo mortgage banker, Frank Chavez , in a letter sent last year to members of the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate banking committee.",1

The bank has been forced to pay $10,000 to each service member affected, plus equity in the cars with interest and repair the service members’ credit.

"While we initially pegged this as a sign that the average US consumer can’t afford to take out a loan with interest rates just 1% higher. But as the CEO of Quicken Loans revealed today during a conversation with Crain’s Detroit Business, another factor might also be at play. Sales figures released by Quicken show that it surpassed Wells Fargo in volume of mortgage originations during the fourth quarter of 2017, bolstering the lender’s claim that it is a viable alternative to the banks that have traditionally dominated the business (and also leveraged it to blow up the US economy a decade ago). Quicken revealed that it originated $25 billion in home loans during the quarter, compared with Wells Fargo’s $23 billion in home mortgages. Wells is the country’s leading bank in home mortgages; Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase & Co. reported $13 billion and $11 billion that quarter, respectively.",1

"Wells Fargo Under Fire Over Unnecessary Auto Insurance Fees 
The New York Times reports that the the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency sent a confidential preliminary report that scolded the bank for making hundreds of thousands of borrowers purchase unnecessary car insurance when they took out an auto loan. An internal report obtained by the Times earlier this year indicated that over 800,000 people who received car loans from Wells Fargo paid for car insurance even usually they already had coverage. Wells Fargo has designated $80M to compensate some 570,000 of these customers, but the comptroller’s office believes that there are more victims and that the total compensation will be higher.

"It is also alleged that Wells Fargo wrongfully foreclosed upon homes owned by borrowers who failed or refused to pay the unlawfully demanded increases. The lawsuit further alleges, that since Wells Fargo drafted both the ARM loan documents and the payment increase notices, Wells Fargo knew and intended that its notices did not comply with its promises, were invalid and that Wells Fargo knew it was collecting monies which did not belong to Wells Fargo. The suit alleges that Wells Fargo, thereby, ""stole"" its borrowers' monies, committing theft by false pretenses, mail fraud and receipt of stolen property. The suit also alleges that since Wells Fargo unlawfully threatened such borrowers with late fees, damage to their credit and foreclosure of their homes if they did not pay the invalid increases, Wells Fargo also committed extortion against such borrowers. In California, victims of stolen property or extortion can recover three times the amount of their damages, plus legal fees and costs under a provision known as Penal Code Section 496.",1

"The sharp drop follows a long period of unprecedented calm in the market. Stocks haven’t had a pullback of 10 per cent or more in two years, and hit their latest record highs just one week ago. “We’ve enjoyed low interest rates for so long, we’re having to deal with a little bit higher rates now, so the market is trying to figure out what that could mean for inflation,” said Darrell Cronk, head of the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. While interest rates are still low by historical standards, meaning borrowing is still relatively cheap for businesses and people, they’ve been rising more swiftly, and that’s what has markets on edge. “The pace of rate increases is more important than the level,” said Nate Thooft, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management.",1
"It also doesn't report fees charged. Now I have original records from all years, except 2016. And the Wells Fargo statement doesn't jive with what I have in Quicken. The total number of shares is now off by a tiny amount, 0.001725 shares. Should I just subtract that amount from Quicken?",1
Thanks to Wells Fargo I lost over $100 in overdraft fees because they were too lazy and ignorant to make the payment on my loan the day they said it would. I'm highly pissed off at them right now.,1

"She replied, “But you know no one ever reads the paperwork.” His response: “Exactly.” You might have heard that Wells Fargo Bank was busted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for opening millions of fraudulent accounts – ruining customer credit scores and finances to rack up profits from big fees – and had to pay a $185 million fine. You might have heard that the bank said management didn’t know about the 1.5 million to 2 million fraudulent accounts that were racking up big profits, gave the head of the division responsible for those accounts a $125 million bonus, blamed low-level employees and fired more than 5,000 of them. Now those former employees have the words “ethics” and “fraud” on their records.",1

Recently after getting married decided we should combine accounts so I applied for a new account in Jan. After calling 9 times and being promised it was going through and expect something in 5 days and even recording the notes and having other customer dis-service folks there read it back to me and then tell me I am sorry but they lied to you. April 6th and NOPE not approved. I am shocked how hard it was to try so hard to give them my business but instead my wife will be closing her account and I will tell everyone to quickly DUMP Wells Fargo and their dishonest schemes and lies.,1

Prudential didn’t quantify the sum that it might pursue. Wells Fargo’s sales practices are being scrutinized on multiple fronts after authorities fined the bank $185 million in September for signing customers up for bank accounts and credit cards without permission. On Wednesday, ProPublica said the firm placed the head of a mortgage-lending unit in Los Angeles, Tom Swanson, on leave while examining allegations some customers were charged to lock in low interest rates when the bank delayed applications.

The “bad acts” the president alluded to, according to Vanity Fair, includes employees opening millions of fake bank and credit card accounts in customers’ names without permission and charging hundreds of thousands of people for auto insurance that they didn’t need as well as charging veterans hidden fees to refinance their mortgages. from Tiffany Favorites https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/08/trump-wells-fargo-penalties-287142",1

"Uncertainty for Non-Agency MBS Investors as Trustees Remain Quiet on Whether they will Follow Wells in Withholding Funds By Brandon Ivey bivey@imfpubs.com One month after Wells Fargo surprised investors in vintage non-agency mortgage-backed securities by withholding millions of dollars in funds, other trustees haven’t responded to inquiries about whether they will take similar actions.“ Five other trustees were unwilling or unable to provide guidance on whether they intend to follow a similar withholding strategy to Wells Fargo,” Fitch Ratings said in a new report. In late June, Wells withheld $94.3 million in funds from investors in 20 non-agency MBS that were subject to clean-up calls by New Residential Investment Corp. The deals in question are the subject of a lawsuit involving MBS investors alleging that Wells failed to perform its duties as trustee. Wells disputed the charges and withheld the funds to cover potential litigation costs.",1

"The field’s main objective, that is, to make a profit, sometimes encourages its players to forgo certain ethical and moral standards in order to achieve said goal. In fact, several companies are even going so far as to indirectly incentivize unethical or otherwise “cutthroat” behavior. An example of such a situation would be in the infamous Wells Fargo scandal, where in a large number of employees of one of the world’s leading banking institutions were allegedly incentivized to create fake accounts via an incentive-compensation program that encouraged them to create new accounts for their clientele. The controversy led to the firing of five-thousand three-hundred employees and five million dollars being set aside for customer refunds on fees for accounts the customers never wanted.

The entire page established to help protect whistleblowers and collect complaints against the bank has been “disappeared.” The page was created in September when the Labor Department launched an investigation into the bank’s treatment of its workers after Wells Fargo admitted setting up secret phony customer accounts to capture bank fees and charge consumers for them. Labor officials sought to aid whistleblowers and to determine if the company violated any wage and overtime regulations while branch employees were pressed to meet tough sales quotas, including setting up the phony accounts. The bank fired 5,300 workers for creating as many as 2 million fake accounts amid employee complaints about an incredibly high-pressure sales culture and mistreatment of workers.",1

"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-28/california... ""California, the nation’s largest issuer of municipal bonds, is barring Wells Fargo & Co. from underwriting state debt and handling its banking transactions after the company admitted to opening potentially millions of bogus customer accounts. The suspension, in effect immediately, will remain in place for 12 months, State Treasurer John Chiang said Wednesday. ""Complete and permanent severance"" between his office and the bank will occur if it doesn’t change its practices, he said. The treasurer is also suspending his office’s investment in Wells Fargo securities. ""Wells Fargo’s fleecing of its customers by opening fraudulent accounts for the purpose of extracting millions in illegal fees demonstrates, at best, a reckless lack of institutional control and, at worst, a culture which actively promotes wanton greed,” the treasurer said in a statement.",1

"Today, they are one of the world s largest financial institutions and one of America s largest mortgage lenders. Traditional Fixed and Adjustable Rates Borrowers looking for a traditional conforming loan of $417,000 or less can take advantage of Wells Fargo s low refinance rates. They have a broad range of fixed and adjustable products including 30-year and 15-year fixed loans as well as three, five, seven and 10 year ARMs which start with a period of fixed interest and then have yearly rate adjustments. While Wells Fargo usually quotes their interest rates with the payment of one discount point, they actually offer a range of different options.",1
"I fucking hate Wells Fargo and I've never actually opened an account with them. They bought up the bank I had a checking account with, and screwed up with overdraft fees that the old bank didn't apply. Then they bought up the company that had my 2 student loans with and proceeded to mess that up. Umm, OK. Fast forward three months later and I get a letter stating I've missed two months worth of payments.",1
"When the CFPB did a crackdown the banking industry’s overdraft fee scam, industry insiders said they’d just impose other fees to replace the lost profits. I realized their model wasn’t to earn a fair fee for a legitimate service, it was an intent to squeeze as many dollars out of their customers as possible, with no relation to service; that because they controlled economic choke points, they were entitled to our money just because they could take it. Wells Fargo used actual fraud in pursuit of this ethos. But they don’t have a monopoly-- use credit unions to avoid their games.",1

"There is no question in the minds of those in cat bird seats that reputation at Wells has been damaged regardless of what WEB says. Despite today's account of Wells Fargo accountability as told by its CEO share price was up by 0.55 (1.20%) - $46.56. Recent reports indicate a potential increase in legal issues and pressure from Senators on the SEC to investigate why Wells Fargo did not disclose to investors the potential risks to share prices associated with the ongoing probe by bank regulators that was started in 2012 or thereabouts. CEO Stumpf's answers at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Capital Hill today in my opinion, made him and the bank look worse. I found myself asking how it is he remains as CEO as his testimony gave evidence to a lack of leadership on many levels on his part and a resulting toxic organizational culture. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said Wells Fargo's practice of generating fees by creating accounts without customers' approval was ""probably criminal activity happening on a large scale. . . .",1

"Under Wells Fargo account guidelines, the bank can charge you a $35 overdraft fee for taking out more than you have in your account. But by reordering the transactions from highest to lowest, putting the $110 charge first, the bank could charge three separate overdraft fees, one for each attempt to draw insufficient funds. Simply by altering the transaction order, Wells Fargo could make an additional $70. Multiply that by millions of customers and you’re talking about serious money. This was a common scheme in the banking industry for years, affecting the poorest customers—those most likely to overdraw their account.",1
"In this sense, arbitration can stop people from enjoying their legal rights, effectively allowing corporations to overturn the law by making it unenforceable. Deepak Gupta, who argued the Concepcion case in 2011, calls arbitration “a basic threat to our democracy.” Incredibly, Wells Fargo went so far as to try and use a separate case to sweep this whole overdraft saga under the rug. In a $142 million settlement over the fake account scandal, Wells Fargo tried to fashion such a broad release—""any and all claims and causes of action of every nature and description""—that it could conceivably have forced some overdraft victims to give up their suits. Lawyers for the overdraft plaintiffs objected, and US district court Judge Vince Chhabria ordered the settlement rewritten to be narrower.",1

"Among them was a payout in the tens of millions of dollars regarding a practice in which Wells Fargo was charging borrowers fees to secure low mortgage rates. The practice reportedly affected more than 100,000 borrowers, and the bank has conceded that a ""substantial number"" of those customers were charged inappropriately. But Trump asserted in a tweet that the CFPB will not be letting Wells Fargo off the hook and said the penalties actually could increase The development comes as Mulvaney has promised substantial changes at the bureau, which he once called a ""joke.""

"On her last day as chair of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen made a clear statement about bank fraud. On Friday, Yellen announced that Wells Fargo, the massive San Francisco-headquartered bank that had followed up its participation in the subprime mortgage-fueled financial crisis with a massive and sustained campaign of fraud — opening up 3.5 million fake bank accounts and also inappropriately charging its customers fees for mortgages and auto insurance —would at last pay a price for such misbehavior. Yellen announced that Wells Fargo would now have to limit its assets to $2 trillion — less than other similarly-sized financial institutions — and would have to replace four of its board members. “We cannot tolerate pervasive and persistent misconduct at any bank,” Yellen said in a statement. These penalties mean Wells Fargo may see its earnings cut by as much as $400 million, Fortune reported, prompting Tim Sloan, Wells Fargo’s CEO, to quickly insist that the bank is “still open for business.”",1

"Federal interest rates have been extremely low for years now and I think they’re beginning to creep back up. Some banks (Wells Fargo, BoA, TD, etc.) know that their names alone will bring them a lot of business and people don’t really grasp the difference between 0.1% and 1.1% interest, so they’ve gotten away with it. I guess you could say that you trade any meaningful interest rate for the convenience of a national brick-and-mortar bank. Anecdotally, when I was in college I knew I was getting screwed by the interest rates at WF, but I needed to 1) Deposit cash because I worked as a waiter and 2) access my money when I went home 700+ miles away.",1

"Eugene Kline of Eaton, Ohio, has something to say about that. He’s been involved in a ten-year battle with Wells Fargo and another big bank, Barclays, over fees assessed while he paid off his mortgage. Wells and Barclays have fought Kline with different explanations at virtually every step, at one point even claiming that accounting systems couldn’t determine if improper fees were charged—as if ignorance might absolve them from blame. The legal odyssey is an example of a disturbingly common practice where banks find fulfilling a basic function—maintaining clear and accurate payment records—incredibly difficult. And it offers insight into how a powerful industry draws out seemingly banal disputes with regular people who rarely have the money, willpower, or time to fight back.",1
"Wells Fargo disputes the descriptions of its foreign-exchange fees by current and former employees. The bank said Monday its fees in 2016 had a weighted average of 0.09 percentage point across all transaction sizes. Clients served by its middle-market banking team were charged a weighted average of 0.18 percentage point, according to Wells Fargo. Some foreign-exchange bankers at Wells Fargo relied on the fact that customers often didn’t bother to double-check how much they were charged, fee levels weren’t straightforward, and complaints could be batted away, the current and former employees say. As WSJ had previously reported, a “large trade” involving Restaurant Brands International – the food-service conglomerate that owns Tim Hortons, Burger King and Popeyes – initially aroused regulators’ suspicions.",1

"Wells Fargo loses big client after dialing up risk in retirement funds BOSTON (Reuters) - After Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) decided to ramp up risk in its flagship age-based retirement funds last year, one of its largest customers decided to call it quits, unhappy with the new investment strategy and how the bank handled the transition. Wells Fargo notified investors in April 2017 that its target-date funds would become more aggressive, outlining a plan for better returns that included buying junk bonds, stocks in emerging markets and derivatives. It was a stark difference from the conservative investment strategy for which the funds were known. TexaSaver, a supplemental retirement program for nearly 240,000 state employees and elected officials, was stunned by the changes, said Georgina Bouton, assistant director of benefit contracts at the Employees Retirement System of Texas. The retirement plan had fewer than 90 days to accept the revamped product or find another investment option.",1

"It’s hard to find a more clear-cut case of securities fraud. Stumpf verbally praised cross-selling metrics to investors when he, by his own admission, knew that those metrics were flawed, underwritten by fake accounts. He never corrected the record, and Wells Fargo to this day has never changed a word of its SEC filings. And fraudulent cross-selling was mostly lucrative to Wells Fargo—the fees on the fake accounts were minimal—insofar as it boosted the stock price. “You should resign, you should give back the money you took while this was going on, and you should be criminally investigated by both the Department of Justice and the SEC,” Warren said.",1

Some critics say Wells Fargo, as well as AT&T, Comcast and other corporations with similar tax-cut related announcements, may be trying to curry favor with the Trump administration for regulatory and acquisition considerations. President Donald Trump said earlier in the month that federal regulators should not ease sanctions and penalties against Wells Fargo related to its consumer-account fraud scandal.

Wells Fargo has always denied that it engages in racial discrimination. But in 2012, staring down the barrel of a lawsuit by the state of Illinois and a U.S. Department of Justice investigation, it agreed to a settlement in which it paid more than $175 million. According to a Department of Justice statement , “Wells Fargo was aware the fees and interest rates it was charging discriminated against African-American and Hispanic borrowers, but the actions it took were insufficient and ineffective in stopping it.” In Cook County, Illinois, between 2004 and 2007, Wells Fargo originated more than 61,000 mortgage loans, more than 25,000 of which were made to minorities, or some 41 percent.",1

"TCF said in a statement it rejects the CFPB’s claims. “We believe we have strong, principled defenses to the CFPB’s complaint,” the bank said, accusing the agency for relying on unrepresentative data and mischaracterizing its practices. The CFPB’s complaint depicted far-reaching marketing efforts at TCF encouraged by senior managers to steer customers into overdraft programs, similar to the CFPB’s allegations last year against sales practices at Wells Fargo & Co. TCF’s strategy included bonuses paid to branch staff for getting a high number of customers to opt in for overdraft services, with some managers imposing opt-in goals for branch employees. The CFPB alleged that TCF’s strategy was so successful that by mid-2014, two in three customers of the bank had opted in to overdraft services, a rate more than triple that of other banks, the CFPB said.

That proposal envisioned a Wells Fargo payout of tens of millions of dollars but likely short of the record $100 million payout it made to the CFPB last year.

While profits in the consumer banking division rose to $3.67 billion compared to $2.73 billion in the same period a year ago, much of that growth was tied to the tax gain that Wells Fargo recorded this quarter. Consumer loans fell to $956.8 billion from $967.6 billion a year earlier, notable in a period when higher economic growth and higher consumer confidence should have translated into more loans issued to consumers.

Home resales declined 2.3 percent in April and could decrease in May as another report on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a home fell for a third straight week last week. “The large declines in the Northeast and Midwest suggest seasonal factors exaggerated the recent slide in pending home sales,” said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. “Mortgage applications add a note of caution, however.” A third report showed manufacturing activity in the Midwest region accelerated to a 2-½-year high in May.",1

"In the original complaint, Bitfinex et al explain that as of Friday, March 31st 2017 Wells Fargo stopped processing outgoing wires without providing any kind of warning or explanation, which “will cause great and irreparable harm to plaintiffs.” They ask for the transfers to not be blocked anymore, and damages in excess of US$75,000. So far, Wells Fargo only submitted a single response (Docket 20), explaining they oppose the Temporary Restraining Order plaintiffs asked for as forcing processing of wire transfers would, among other things, “place an affirmative duty on Defendants where none currently exists.” The case will not be moving quickly, as the following schedule has been set: •By April 12th: Opening brief•

"Denny Russo, a former bank teller at Wells Fargo in Petaluma, California, had a similar story — one mirrored by another Wells Fargo employee in Utah. “When foot traffic was slow, the branch manager on duty instructed Wells Fargo employees of Hispanic heritage to go to a nearby 7-Eleven at 430 Washington St. in Petaluma, a known congregating point for undocumented day laborers,” Russo said in his sworn statement. “Employees were instructed to ’round up’ a group of undocumented workers and drive them back to the Wells Fargo branch to open up checking and savings accounts in exchange for ‘waiving‘ check-cashing fees that the day laborers would otherwise have to pay,” claimed Russo. In many cases, the bank’s employees would then open up additional accounts such as credit cards, which the customers had not requested — and which generated sales commission for Wells Fargo. Ancel Martinez, Wells Fargo’s vice president of corporate communications, denied the allegations brought by the shareholder lawsuit.",1

RT @renato_mariotti: Today we learned Wells Fargo bankers charged hundreds of customers inflated foreign transaction fees. Yet Trump wants to neuter the CFPB consumer protection bureau. huffingtonpost.com/entry/wells-fa…,1
I was only ever paying fees for my Pentagon Federal checking account which is a credit union... My question wasn't about fees just if I'll age out of the Navy Federal Campus checking or if I'll have to switch it on my own. I've had my Wells Fargo teen checking account for years now.,1
My bank was taken over by Wells Fargo and they offered if you changed your deposits to direct deposit there would be no fee--no problem. Then they changed that and started charging a fee again BUT if you paid your bills through their payment program no fee--no problem! Then they started charging more fees but if you open another account with them no fees--now I see why!!!,1
@Ask_WellsFargo Which makes my interest go up which adds fees. Its ridiculous. I'm about to change banks. I'm a college student and I feel like I'm drowning,1
"These kids would likely all be white or mostly white. And no, it's not easy for Hispanics or African Americans to move into those communities due to cost and racist bank practices. Wells Fargo has lost lawsuits in the last 5 years and has multiple lawsuits pending for having tens of thousands of loans in cities where they gave higher interest rates for people of color thus lowering what homes they could afford. So what we have is systematic exclusion of people of color from access to the best schools. We then have kids who go to college and never meet anyone different than themselves.",1
"In the case of Wells Fargo, on the subject of binding arbitration vs public court, there are real damages being claimed: http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-wells-fargo-20170824-story.html A group of Wells Fargo & Co. customers who say they were victims of unfair overdraft practices want their claims heard in court, but the bank wants the disputes handled through arbitration. Class-action lawsuits filed around the country have accused Wells Fargo of changing the order of debit card transactions — from highest dollar amount to lowest dollar amount — to unfairly increase the number of transactions eligible for overdraft penalties. Then the other class action lawsuit about fraudulent bank accounts was deflected to binding arbitration, as required when signing up for an account: http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-wells-arbitration-20160926-snap-story.html Nothing demonstrates that more than the bank’s insistence on forcing the victims of its vast fake-account scam into binding arbitration, a system in which customers are at an overwhelming disadvantage. As my colleague James Rufus Koren reported last year, the San Francisco-based bank has succeeded in getting several judges to toss fraud lawsuits over the bogus accounts by asserting that, even though the accounts are fake, they stem from legitimate accounts the victims opened, in which they agreed to submit any future disputes with the bank to an arbitrator.",1

"Wells Fargo is the nation’s largest home mortgage lender, according to The New York Times, so it was particularly concerning for some Black homeowners to discover the bank’s history of racial bias and discrimination. In a 2012 announcement from the Justice Department, it was revealed that Wells Fargo agreed to pay at least $175 million to settle accusations that it discriminated against both Black and Hispanic borrowers during the housing boom. The department had launched a civil rights investigation that revealed mortgage brokers working at Wells Fargo were charging Black borrowers and Hispanic borrowers higher fees and rates than their white counterparts who had similar financial profiles, the Timesreported. The bank was also accused of steering “more than 4,000 minority borrowers into costlier subprime mortgages when white borrowers with similar credit risk profiles had received regular loans,” theTimes added.

"Four months later the car is repossessed again for, you guessed it, 1200 dollars in late fees which did not exist. Once again two phone calls forced the repo company to release the car with no money required since each time the car was illegally repossessed. It was repossessed one more time before we had a very long chat with wells fargo to find out that our vin number was recorded twice in their systems. One for our account, and one for another account in a completely different name. The car listed is same make and model and color of ours.",1
"WellsFargo is known for doing sketchy things however there's no reason to believe this was their fault. When you make a transaction there's many parties that handle it; yourself as the authorizer, the company you're paying to, VISA/MasterCard/etc as the processors and the financial institution (in this case WellsFargo) who acts as the middleman. If we assume the company you're paying to hasn't fully processed the transaction yet, then you won't immediately see the pending item. For now, you can request an overdraft fee reversal as a courtesy (assuming you don't have any prior) but ultimately it comes down to you to keep effective knowledge of your balances because it's YOUR money and no one cares about it but yourself, you shouldn't rely solely on the institution.",1

"Wells Fargo’s latest legal issue involves credit card fees For many years, high-to-low posting order was standard in the banking industry, the spokesman said. “In 2010, Wells Fargo eliminated high-to-low posting order for debit card transactions and moved to chronological posting-order for these items (the bank also moved to chronological posting-order for checks and ACH transactions in 2014),” he added. It’s not unusual for big corporations to try to force customers into arbitration, since it tends to keep legal costs down. In fact, it’s so popular that Wells Fargo already tried it before in this case — and lost. In 2011, three years after the reordering case was filed, Wells Fargo asked the trial judge to order the depositor/victims to pursue their grievances via arbitration.",1

"“We are deeply sorry for the hardship this creates for affected team members, and we are doing everything in our power to resolve the situation as quickly as possible,” Ms. Rodriguez said. Bryan Hubbard, a spokesman for the O.C.C., declined to elaborate beyond the highly technical two-sentence statement the agency released in November describing the additional restrictions being placed on Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo has been in turmoil since September, when it admitted that thousands of its employees, under pressure to meet aggressive sales goals, had created as many as two million fraudulent accounts in the names of real customers. Some customers did not learn of the sham accounts until they began incurring fees on them. The O.C.C. — which participated in a $185 million settlement deal with Wells Fargo that resolved several government lawsuits — initially let the bank off fairly lightly, exempting it from some of the restrictions normally imposed on banks that break the law.",1

"Frerichs was uncertain how much the yearlong suspension would cost the nation's second-largest bank, which serves as broker-dealer for state investments, but said it likely amounts to millions of dollars. ""Wells Fargo is a big financial player in Illinois, and I hope to send the message that their unscrupulous practices are not welcome and will not be tolerated,"" the Democrat said at a news conference in Chicago. The move by Illinois, which has nearly $1 trillion a year in banking activities, follows closely on similar action last week by California after regulators in that state and the federal government fined the company $185 million. A federal consent order issued in September found that bank employees, scrambling to meet sales goals, opened about 2 million deposit, credit card, debit card and online accounts without customers' knowledge, charging fees and, in some cases, damaging their credit so they had to pay higher interest rates on loans. Frerichs noted that Wells Fargo in 2012 paid a $175 million joint settlement, which included Illinois, to settle allegations its independent brokers racially discriminating against 3,000 mortgage borrowers.",1

"""No one who works for a firm receiving direct financial assistance from the Fed should be allowed to sit on the Fed's board of directors or be employed by the Fed,"" he said. The investigation also revealed that the Fed outsourced most of its emergency lending programs to private contractors, many of which also were recipients of extremely low-interest and then-secret loans. The Fed outsourced virtually all of the operations of their emergency lending programs to private contractors like JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.

"Quote Post by Meg77 » Mon Jan 23, 2017 9:38 pm I'm a private banker, and we exist largely to handle the type of loan you are referring to. To get a conforming/conventional mortgage loan, the loan has to be in an individual's name. If you want to hold title in a trust or other entity, you'll need a private bank loan or commercial loan which is held by the bank and not sold to a mortgage investor (such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mack, Wells Fargo, etc.). These loans usually have higher interest rates and shorter terms, since no government agency is subsidizing the interest rate risk.

"BOSTON (Reuters) - After Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) decided to ramp up risk in its flagship age-based retirement funds last year, one of its largest customers decided to call it quits, unhappy with the new investment strategy and how the bank handled the transition. Wells Fargo notified investors in April 2017 that its target-date funds would become more aggressive, outlining a plan for better returns that included buying junk bonds, stocks in emerging markets and derivatives. It was a stark difference from the conservative investment strategy for which the funds were known. TexaSaver, a supplemental retirement program for nearly 240,000 state employees and elected officials, was stunned by the changes, said Georgina Bouton, assistant director of benefit contracts at the Employees Retirement System of Texas. The retirement plan had fewer than 90 days to accept the revamped product or find another investment option.",1

"So there's not as much urgency to do anything. Wells Fargo can sit back and collect thousands in servicing and late fees until the owner of the loan compels them to begin foreclosure.

"I earn several hundred in interest each year, and that's only going to go up this year as interest rates went up recently. Regarding access to assistance, I'd say that every online bank I've used has had superior customer service to any of the big banks I've used. Take a look at the scandals over the last year with big banks like Wells Fargo's false account creation plus all of the fees that big banks like to throw at you. No successful online bank pulls that kind of stunt, they get easily found out and flounder when no one wants to do business with them as customers go to other, better options. I understand some people's trepidation, but given online banks are FDIC insured as well and have better service/fewer issues, sticking with the big banks for most of your needs is mostly just resisting the changing times.",1
"When reported, the focus was on the fees Wells Fargo collected and the implication was that was why they did it. I think the real reason was to expand the bank's assets. If the customers didn't know they had the loans, they don't spend them and the bank increased its assets by the maximum loan amounts extended without ever having to pay anything because the credit remains unused. But the credit shows up as an asset on the bank's balance sheet and other banks give it better lending terms because it appears to be worth more on paper. Thus the balance sheet expansion creates money out of thin air by making loans that no one will ever use, and using the expanded asset value to get better terms on its deals.",1

"Most economists predict that interest rates will rise steadily through 2016, although plunging equity markets in the U.S. and overseas have trumped that premise so far.

A home mortgage sign on a Wells Fargo branch in Brooklyn, New York. “As a result of more financial market volatility and continued flight to quality by investors, mortgage rates have decreased 18 basis points since the first week of January 2016,” said Joel Kan, an MBA economist. “With a 30-year fixed rate of 4.02 percent in the most recent week, the refinance index was at its highest since the week ending October 1, 2015, a week when rates were 3.99 percent, and there was a rush of applications before the Know Before You Owe rule implementation deadline.”",1

"Wells Fargo Killing Sham Account Suits by Using Arbitration Wells Fargo employees created as many as 2 million unauthorized credit and bank accounts. Wells Fargo has already agreed to reimburse any customers who paid fees associated with the false accounts they did not know they had, with most fees being less than $100. If you were a Wells Fargo executive, would you: (1) address other claims for wrongdoing be addressed in a civil court, or (2) lobby to have them heard on a case-by-case basis in arbitration instead? Why?",1
"Since a pair of Supreme Court rulings in 2011 and 2013 allowed for the widespread use of arbitration, companies have had great success enforcing these clauses. Proponents of arbitration say the process is a more efficient way to settle disputes than class-action lawsuits that end up mostly enriching plaintiffs’ lawyers. “By resolving legal disputes through arbitration, both the consumer and the business have the ability to reach a positive resolution at a lower cost,” Wells Fargo said in its statement. Arbitrators are typically lawyers or retired judges who are paid large fees to conduct hearings. The arbitrators, critics say, have an economic interest in siding with the companies, which bring them multiple cases, while individual consumers are likely to appear before them only once.",1

As for your alternate choices.",1
"This year, the government stepped in to re-order both agencies, in view of tremendous losses due to bad loans made by subsidiary lenders, so expect some very detailed questions and a hard look at your credit report if you are mortgaging through them. On the other hand, the purpose of these agencies is to make low-cost loans available, so you will likely get a good interest rate if you qualify. 2) Wells Fargo Mortgage With a portfolio of $77 billion in 2010, Wells Fargo is the largest private mortgage lender in the country. With 23.9% of the market share, this bank has offices nationwide and offers competitive interest rates to qualified borrowers.",1
"Dutch financial group ING (INGA.AS) has confirmed that Bitfinex, one of the world’s largest Bitcoin exchanges by daily trading volume, has a bank account with them in the Netherlands, Reuters reported Tuesday, Feb. 20. In an email to Reuters, ING spokesperson Harold Reusken confirmed that Bitfinex has a bank account with ING in the Netherlands. How Bitfinex was managing its banking affairs since a split with Wells Fargo last April is unclear, Reuters reports. The connection between Bitfinex and ING was first reported on Feb. 14 by Dutch news outlet Follow the Money. According to Follow the Money, ING bank cannot disclose the value of Bitfinex’s account due to privacy laws.",1
I try very hard not to get mad at customer service workers but it took me 20 minutes to explain to the Wells Fargo lady that I wasn’t calling her about the money that was taken out of my account even though the card was declined and not about being charged international fees and now I’m being transferred to a third person and I’m literally about to lose my shit,1
I have lived in harmony with mine for 25+ years. It doesn't hurt to check it out and a lot of times just going in to a local CU with questions can help you get a better understanding. E.g.: My wife had a Wells Fargo account with a car loan. She assured me that she had the lowest APR and was fine. I convinced her to just try my credit union.,1
Some of the payday companies have managed to work with me and some completely denied my requests and said I have to pay them by the evening. I've already changed my direct deposit information from my regular bank (Wells Fargo) to my credit union so they can no longer take over my paychecks (unless they start garnishing my wages). I already called Wells Fargo to let them know that these payday companies are going to run the checks. They told me some will go through and some will be returned & that they will work with me about the overdraft/return fees I'll probably get. So once I default and they get sent to collections how bad will my credit tank?,1
"Wells Fargo said in October that it would refund homebuyers who were wrongly charged fees to secure low mortgage rates, a black mark against a lender that already had been roiled by scandal over its treatment of customers. Richard Cordray, the Obama-era official who left as head of the CFPB last month, had approved the terms of a possible settlement with Wells Fargo over the fees, according to three sources familiar with the matter. That proposal envisioned a Wells Fargo payout of tens of millions of dollars but likely short of the record $100 million payout it made to the CFPB last year. Legal experts said it is highly unusual for presidents to weigh in on specific financial enforcement actions. Even regulatory chiefs typically do not comment on ongoing investigations, concerned that public remarks could compromise the case in some way.",1
"Good point. I'll update the chart. In April 2017 Wells Fargo cut banking ties with Bitfinex. I should also annotate it with the date (2 Aug 2016) Bitfinex got hacked for $72,000,000.",1
"So, if you're an individual and you steal a few bucks from a big corporation, you get the full brunt of the law against you. However, if you're a small corporation of doctors, you can steal from the taxpayer and just get a fine--no arrests, photos or fingerprints. An even bigger example than the local story above is the recent Wells Fargo ruse where bank employees established thousands of accounts for unknowing ""customers"" just so the bank could collect fees and make a mint. 5,300 bankers were fired and the two executives blamed for the fraud had to pay back several million in compensation they were previously paid, but no jail time for anyone as far as I know. The powers-that-be want us to believe that our differences are based on skin color and religious beliefs, when the real divider is one of wealth and power---the haves and the have nots.",1
"First, mine has frustratingly difficult to use business services. I enjoy the low fees, but prefer the business banking of Wells Fargo (or any other bank) for the business tailored services. Yes, I use Wells Fargo for my business, and no, I'm not moving. Also, when I travel out of country, I keep a Chase credit card account, just because I think its wiser to have an international bank handling those transactions. tl;dr: Credit Unions are a smart choice.",1

"If you are looking for a construction loan, Wells Fargo offers some options, such as a rate-lock option that lets you set the interest rate while the home is being built. This protects you from rising interest rates while your home is under construction. But if rates decrease, Wells Fargo offers a one-time floatdown to the lower rate. Wells Fargo’s online calculator provides rates and estimated down payments. Because closing costs depend on fees beyond the bank’s control, we looked only at bank fees like underwriting and processing that are paid as part of closing costs.",1

"As you build a relationship with them (i.e. Have an account open and active with them over time) you will gain access to some of the best interest rates around for loans. This means a vehicle loan or mortgage would cost less over a major bank like BoA, Wells Fargo, etc. Some FCUs also have credit card offers, but if you have no credit history yet it may not be available to you initially. I would recommend applying for a Discover It student credit card as the benefits are excellent for a first CC. Your approved limit (how much total you are allowed to spend using the card at any given time) may be low and your interest rate high initially if no credit history exists, but that is perfectly fine as long as it is used responsibly.",1

"Also banks can't choose the order they process payments in, in order to rack up late fees.

"Hi all, I'm closing on my first house in 2 weeks and I was browsing some posts here and saw some posts about closing costs that made me want to ask about my own here because they seem high in comparison. I'm buying a house for $78,100 mortgage through wells fargo. The loan is an FHA loan and The closing costs with the 3% down payment comes out to $8740. Now I've had very little explanation on the whole thing so I'm literally clueless on what is necessary or not which is why I'm here looking for advise in case WF is trying to shaft me for some un-needed charges.",1
"My stomach was sick and I was having worse breathing issues and chest pains from the increased anxiety. I filed a claim with Wells Fargo for them to reverse the charge. They gave me a provisional credit of $186.78 and then they said I needed to show the bill was satisfied or they'd take back the provisional credit, which they did because I couldn't get Arpia to file the claim with Medicare. I fought round and round with them and medicare to no avail so I packed up my rented concentrator and took it back to Apria in Panama City, Fl along with the hard data card from my APAP machine to upload the information to satisfy that part of their paperwork they said they didn't have. My family chipped in and helped me purchase the oxygen concentrator I needed.",1

"So while I don't like it as much as the next guy, I wouldn't have sore feelings against Ally specifically in your case. Nature of the beast I'm sorry to say unless to go in-person to a brick & mortar bank (which can't match online banking interest rates due to overhead, etc.). Best advice would be to then search out good local credit unions which can be more competitive than big-names like Chase, Wells Fargo, etc. in terms of savings rates.",1
"Wiki lists Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, Principal Funds, Wells Fargo Advantage, American Century, and Northern Trust. They probably won't differ a lot in their long term results. Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, American Century, and Wells Fargo are some of the biggest and most well known, to me at least. The odds are small that a scandal at one of these fund managers would lose your money, but cut your risk and split it into two or three different companies. BTW, mutual funds often have transaction fees around $100 for each purchase or sale, so find out the ""transaction"" fees and ""loads,"" if any.",1
"The Commerce Department will release its advance second-quarter GDP estimate on Friday at 8:30 a.m. EDT. A rebound in growth, together with a tightening labor market, would leave the Federal Reserve on course to announce a plan to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in September as well as raise interest rates for a third time this year. “The Fed is certainly looking for a rebound in the strength of GDP growth that maintains the moderate economic expansion we have seen during this current economic cycle,” said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. “That would allow plans for further monetary policy tightening.” The U.S. central bank left rates unchanged on Wednesday and said it expected to start winding down its portfolio “relatively soon.”",1

"Wells Fargo has been known for deceptive practices, they sign you up for new accounts without your permission, (allegedly) commit minor mortgage fraud, other shady practices. Many big banks make their employees prioritize what amounts to sales goals over everything else, Wells Fargo and BofA are typically the worst offenders, paying huge fines and constantly laying off thousands of employees once the market slows.

"Parnassus Endeavor Fund, a top-30 investor in Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), said it will vote in favor of the company's current board and against the slate of directors proposed by Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). The public show of support from a major shareholder is a strong vote of confidence for Qualcomm's management and reinforces the decision to fight for a higher takeover offer. Wells Fargo said four board members will retire next month at the bank's annual meeting, in the latest changes resulting from last year's sales scandal. John Chen, Lloyd Dean and Enrique Hernandez - the three longest-serving members - and Federico Peña will leave the board on April 24.

"(2) The bank has also acknowledged charging another half million customers for auto insurance they neither needed nor sought, pushing more than a quarter million of them into delinquency on their car and insurance payments, and leading to nearly 25,000 wrongful vehicle repossessions. (3) Wells Fargo also enrolled thousands of customers in online bill-pay services they never wanted, charging them nearly a billion dollars in fees. (4) As if this weren't enough, Wells Fargo has argued in federal court that its bilked customers have no right to sue the bank as a group, but have to rely on individual arbitration that would likely cost them more in legal fees than any damage reward they might receive. (5) In February, the Federal Reserve took the unprecedented action of forcing the bank to replace four of its directors and capping its growth until the bank develops better risk-management practices. So why, exactly, does Wells Fargo's CEO get a $4.6 million raise?",1

Gabriel Arocha Bernie would without a doubt torch these two in any debates and I'm a believer that the heart of the country is successful small businesses but I'm not sure I agree with how he gets there. All these regulations that are meant to stop corruption are making it expensive for small businesses to open while these large corporations have the resources and lawyers to finagle their way around them. We all now if our local savings bank or credit union took millions from customers the owners would be in jail but we get to these large banks like Wells Fargo and they say it's too big for the CEO to be held accountable because he probably didn't know it was going on. Bring people back to small local business and there is more accountability and less will be affected by any fraudulent behavior.,0

"The centerpiece of the swindle, as usual, is control fraud on the grand scale.

Control fraud is at work in the corporate C-suites, of course, because that is its natural habitat — remember that silver-haired CEO swine from Wells Fargo who got off scot-free with a life-time supply of acorns after scamming his account-holders — but their errand boys and girls in congress have been superbly groomed, pampered, fed, and trained to break trail and cover for them.

The first complaint the department received came from a North Carolina-based Army National Guardsman who stated that Wells Fargo seized his vehicle while he was making preparations to deploy to Afghanistan. Then, says the department, the bank auctioned the car and attempted to collect $10,000 from the Guardsman’s family.

"Aflac spokesman Jon Sullivan responded to a detailed list of questions by saying the company “will not comment on pending litigation.” The allegations in the lawsuits include: •Recruiting thousands of employees with promises of six-figure incomes in the first year, which ultimately less than 2 percent of new hires manage to earn
•Encouraging employees to sell policies to friends and relatives and recruit them into the company, akin to a multi-level marketing scheme
•Widespread misclassification of employees as independent contractors, despite Aflac controlling virtually every aspect of the work experience
•Much like at Wells Fargo, employees under pressure to meet sales goals selling policies without customer authorization or consent, illegally “bundling” policies, and issuing others to ineligible customers
•Wage theft, where commissions rightfully owed to associates are transferred to managers
•At least one charge of sexual harassment
•Massaging of key operational metrics to prove company growth to investors
•Earnings statement manipulation, by moving sales earned in certain weeks into different quarters to hit numbers
•Retaliation against whistleblowers Employees initially presented the allegations to management through official company channels in December 2016, at which point Aflac management categorically denied them. However, the company thereafter made several changes to its recruiting materials, compensation plan, and operational metrics, suggesting at least some validity to the claims — or a striking coincidence.",0

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency -- the primary regulator for the firm’s banking operations -- soon followed up with more sanctions, including its own effort to squeeze the lender’s growth in late 2016.Late last year, the OCC told the bank’s board that authorities may take additional enforcement actions over the auto insurance and mortgage improprieties, people familiar with the situation said. — With assistance by Kenneth Pringle, and Ros KrasnySent from my iPad",0

The report reviewed policies sold to Wells Fargo customers from January 2012 through July 2016.

But how much larger is the fraud perpetrated by the Federal Reserve System and why does the Fed continue to go unpunished?",0

"The “War on Terror” is a pre-planned effort on the part of a) CENTRAL BANKING, b) BIG OIL, c) WEAPONS MANUFACTURERS, & d) CIA/MI6/MOSSAD & the PENTAGON ~ to wage a never-ending war, for profit & total control. The “War on Drugs” is equally a total sham, because the Western “elites” originally became so rich due to the DUTCH & BRITISH OPIUM TRADE WITH CHINA, under the Dutch & British East India Companies. The TOO-BIG-TO-FAIL BANKS, behind the BIS/IMF/World Bank/ECB/”Federal” “Reserve”/SWIFT Payment System (like HSBC, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs) ~ LAUNDER the proceeds! The House of Saud was placed in power by the ‘City’ of London & MI6. The “28 Pages” blaming SAUDi Arabia for 9/11 is clearly ‘the West’ throwing their PROXY, Saudi Arabia, under the bus, very conveniently, and completely ignoring the TRUTH, which is that the blame for 9/11 rests squarely with the CIA/MOSSAD, as well as the NSA/GCHQ.",0

No heat here, but I just wanted to point out that the CEO didn't voluntary take a pay cut, the share holers slashed his pay and he didn't have a choice.

"When it broke the news of Wells Fargo’s impropriety, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) said that employees were motivated to make these accounts because of stringent sales quotas that upper management put on them.

CNN Money reported last week that several employees who called Wells Fargo’s anonymous ethics line to report that they were being encouraged to open unauthorized accounts were quickly fired for ostensibly unrelated reasons. The Senate Banking Committee was especially concerned that Wells Fargo seemed to be scapegoating lower-level employees. This Monday, the senators referred the issue to the US Labor Department, which will begin a full investigation into how Wells Fargo has treated its employees in the last five years.",0

"The rule was first proposed by Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who wanted a firewall between a bank's consumer operations and its risky trading activities. Another target could be the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a Dodd-Frank creation that imposed new regulations in areas such as mortgage-servicing, foreclosure relief services, debt collection and more. Republicans might be reluctant to wipe out the agency just months after a scandal at Wells Fargo involving sham customer accounts. But the new Congress is widely expected to change the CFPB's management structure so that instead of having a single, powerful director, it would operate under a slower-moving commission. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, in testimony to Congress in September, defended Dodd-Frank, saying the new rules have improved safety in the financial industry.",0

Sloan said he was disappointed by some municipalities’ decisions to suspend business or put the bank “on probation,” but that it was also understandable. The firm’s business with government entities “is the best in the industry,” had been growing, “and we’re going to work hard to win that business back,” he said. California’s Push

California, the nation’s largest issuer of municipal bonds, barred Wells Fargo last month from underwriting state debt and handling its banking transactions for a year. State Treasurer John Chiang, a Democrat who’s running for governor in 2018, called on Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf to quit and threatened a “complete and permanent severance” of dealings if the firm doesn’t change practices.",0

Hall, AP Wells Fargo 3Q delivers an unwelcome surprise for investors 1 / 1 Back to Gallery NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo's third-quarter profits took a beating this quarter, falling 18 percent, after the bank had to set aside about $1 billion for legal expenses related to its mortgage practices before the financial crisis. The legacy from last decade's housing bubble bit Wells at a time when the San Francisco-based bank is trying to move beyond its phony account scandal from last year and another more recent scandal tied to its auto lending business. Wells Fargo said Friday that it earned $4.6 billion in the third quarter, or 84 cents a share, down from $5.64 billion, or $1.03 a share, in the same period a year earlier.",0

"Meanwhile, in the coverage flap over unnecessary collision insurance, an internal company report found that when consumers financed a vehicle through Wells Fargo, the bank passed along their information to insurance underwriter National General, which was supposed to verify whether the borrower had insurance. If not, coverage was automatically added to the total owed on the loan alongside the vehicle payments and interest. But apparently coverage was added even when the buyer already had insurance; by Wells Fargo’s estimates, some 570,000 customers may have been needlessly insured, and of those, about 20,000 may have lost their vehicles because they were unable to afford the unexpectedly higher charges and defaulted on their loans. The report reviewed policies sold to Wells Fargo customers from January 2012 through July 2016. The New York Times was first with the story on the unnecessary auto insurance, after obtaining an internal report by consulting firm Oliver Wyman.",0

"5. JPMorgan Chase Recently admitted their company’s links to slavery. “Today, we are reporting that this research found that, between 1831 and 1865, two of our predecessor banks—Citizens Bank and Canal Bank in Louisiana—accepted approximately 13,000 enslaved individuals as collateral on loans and took ownership of approximately 1,250 of them when the plantation owners defaulted on the loans,” the company wrote in a statement. 6. Wachovia Corporation / Wells Fargo USA Today reported that Wachovia Corporation (now owned by Wells Fargo) has apologized for its ties to slavery after disclosing that two of its historical predecessors owned enslaved Africans and accepted them as payment. “On behalf of Wachovia Corporation, I apologize to all Americans, and especially to African-Americans and people of African descent,” said Ken Thompson, Wachovia chairman and chief executive officer, in the statement released late Wednesday. “We are deeply saddened by these findings.”",0
"For the banks closed down and taken over by the FDIC, it doesn't seem like it took more than 48 hours to rectify that problem. Indymac is a good example where it was allowed to happen quickly.

Right. I completely agree too big to fail = too big to exist.",0

The fact that you said the WF Manager expected them to send out a fraud alert, tells me that the Manager probably isn't exactly the swiftest person either, or perhaps he is just saying that to appease you.

"Stumpf, who appears to have put his fist through a wall, did not handle himself well. Naked Capitalism’s Yves Smith parses through his blunders and suggests that this will likely lead to criminal prosecution, in part because of Stumpf’s unwillingness to consider giving back any of the millions the bank paid to him and his top execs while they turned a blind eye to a fraud that affected 2,000,000 Wells Fargo customers – trashing their credit records, pilfering from their accounts, then hitting them with fines and penalties. Stumpf also refused to consider calling the credit reporting bureaux to repair the customer credit ratings damaged by his fraud; instead, his bank will take the much more expensive step of phoning each of those customers – and then trying to sell them more Wells Fargo products. The bank requires its customers to surrender their right to sue, submitting instead to binding arbitration when they open accounts – and now they say that this clause applies to accounts that weren’t opened by the defrauded customers, but rather, by bank employees who were committing frauds against them. That is, you “agree” to binding arbitration with Wells Fargo even when the “agreement” is made without your knowledge and consent in the course of Wells Fargo committing a crime to which you are the victim.",0

I never see my balance or never have any money left ove to pay the rest of my other bills on my checking account. Besides I have {$600.00} or {$400.00} to deposit and still be short at times. My problem with the Wells Fargo bank is that they never have enough money to pay my mortgage or any bills. Three years ago I went to the branch at XXXX XXXX and XXXX and deposit {$600.00} on my sister account and she lives in Florida and she never received it . A week later I asked her if she got the money her response was no i have n't.,0
"Wells Fargo has been offering banking services in San Marcos for decades, and it has a presence at the L-B-J Student Center. The bank, though, has been mired in scandal in recent months. Some Wells Fargo employees were caught creating fake bank accounts to earn bonuses, and the institution has also been accused of charging customers for auto insurance they didn’t need. Fortune Magazine recently had an article stating some doubt that Wells Fargo can survive the scandals. However, the negative publicity seems NOT to have fazed students at Texas State.",0
"But he didn't make it through. Business Insider's Rachael Levy took a close look at the life and sudden death of the young, star money manager .

You can follow a blow-by-blow account of the hearing here .",0
"REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni A Wells Fargo bank teller accused of stealing $185,000 from a homeless customer has agreed to a plea deal, according to court documents cited by The Washington Post. The former employee, 29-year-old Phelon Davis, pleaded guilty to a felony charge of interstate transfer of stolen property this week after a 2014 encounter with a homeless customer who tried to deposit $185,000 in cash at a Wells Fargo branch in Washington, DC, the court documents said. The customer, who was not named but was described as a homeless street vendor, had existing accounts at the bank, but he lacked the identification documents he needed to deposit the $185,000 worth of cash he had been carrying in a garbage bag.",0
"Things have gotten so bad that John said he is taking Xanax to control his panic attacks. ""It's beyond embarrassing to admit I am a current employee these days. My family and friends think I'm a fraud for working at Wells,"" John said. It's been just over seven weeks since Wells Fargo admitted to creating as many as 2 million unauthorized accounts and firing 5,300 workers since 2011. The scandal led to the abrupt retirement of longtime CEO John Stumpf .",0

"That being said it was not the subprime loans that caused the credit crunch. What caused the credit crunch was packaging those mortgages together and selling them as AAA assets to investment bankers. Investment bankers which, because of the overturning of Glass-Steagall included banks that used to be prohibited from trading like BofA, Wells Fargo, Chase etc. It was made even worse when people who caught wind of the banks buying these assets that were rated as AAA but really should have been junk bonds offered to create security derivatives off of those assets. When the house came down...literally...the big banks and investments firms were left holding bag. At that point we had a choice let the banks default and fail or bail them out.",0

"Not nearly as great at the corporate tax cut, but still it's there and it will be significant for some people. The more important aspect of the corporate tax cut is the effect it will have in lowering operating costs for operations in the US. Already, we've seen a few companies explicitly acknowledge this windfall by declaring bonuses or in the case of Wells Fargo raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour. I think we'll see more wage increases as we go along as the labor supply gets tighter and companies have extra funds to devote to wages. Also, the excise taxes placed on overseas transactions to discourage companies from parking their money in tax havens will have the effect of repatriating that money to the US, where again it can be used to increase wages.",0

"Ratings agencies were also complicit, giving a AAA rating to these unregulated financial instruments which were then peddled to investors and traded on Wall Street, leading to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. As the New York Times reported, banks used their newfound deregulation to aggressively push subprime loans onto black communities, like Baltimore. Shortly after Clinton’s deregulation passed, Wells Fargo went on a subprime crusade in Baltimore. Over half of all the Baltimore homes in foreclosure that had Wells Fargo loans between 2005 and 2008 are now vacant, and 71 percent of those homes are in black neighborhoods. Tony Paschal, who was a Wells Fargo loan officer working out of Northern Virginia between 1997 and 2007, described the bank’s ruthless targeting of people of color:",0

Both of these seasoned Senators from the FINANCE COMMITTEE hearings circuit this past summer expressed no surprise nor challenged then combined CEO\CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD Stumpf when the somewhat conflicted leader of the enterprise and leader of the watchdog board of directors claimed he knew nothing about the Card Services Business Line revenue stream flowing from the unauthorized credit card openings by WELLS FARGO (WF) WACHOVIA customers. In fact WF WACHOVIA does not market or sell its credit card to anyone who doesn't already have a business relationship with the myriad banks, insurance companies, brokerages, traders, insurance concerns, mortgage lenders, securitized retail and wholesale lenders and re-bundlers of debt etc it has swallowed up with so many winks and nods from the comatose Anti-Trust Federal Regulators Teddy Roosevelt of the once Public Interest-oriented GOP. However, no corporate officer from top down to heads of business lines can claim to be unaware of the revenue streams or shortfalls of carefully policed revenue goals for each business Wells Fargo has acquired since it was acquired itself in the late 1990's by smaller Midwestern real estate lender NORWEST BANCORP which led to a de-regulated bacchanal and orgy of acquisitions of most regional competition within the trans national financial services empire of WF WACHOVIA. There were few if any concerns about anti-competitive or anti-trust enforcement, even after the 2008 Cheney-Bush U.S. Treasury bail-out of the TOO BIG TO FAIL\JAIL BANKS with taxpayer funds by former Goldman Sachs turned U.S. Treasurer and bail-out czar Hank Paulson.",0

These conflicts are among the reasons why five Democratic senators introduced a bill Thursday to require Trump and his family to divest of all his holdings that might present ethical problems and place them in a blind trust. The bill would also assert that any violations of conflict of interest laws would constitute “a high crime or misdemeanor under the impeachment clause of the U.S. Constitution.”",0

Supporters of the CFPB rule like Public Citizen’s Robert Weissman called the vote a choice “between corporate donors and constituents.” Amanda Werner, who gained notoriety for dressing as the Monopoly Man during Senate hearings on Wells Fargo and Equifax, notes that lawmakers opposing the arbitration rule received over $100 million in campaign contributions from the financial industry during their careers. “These contributions help explain why lawmakers are willing to aid and abet big banks in ripping off their own constituents despite overwhelming bipartisan support for the rule,” Werner said in a statement to The Intercept. The Chamber of Commerce and other financial lobbyists had joined together to sue CFPB over the rule, but with the Senate’s successful vote, that will no longer be necessary.",0

"The overall index is now at 100, up 20 points since November and up 33 points from one year ago. This represents the largest quarterly increase in three years. These results are based on the latest Wells Fargo/Gallup survey of small-business owners, conducted Feb. 6-10. Owners are usually more positive about the future than they are about present conditions, and that pattern holds in the latest update. However, the rise in the index from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter this year is mostly a function of owners' increased optimism about current conditions, with the first-quarter score of 40 representing a 16-point jump since last quarter.",0

"For more than a decade, Wells Fargo has set unsustainable sales-targets for its low-level staffers, firing those who don’t perform and turning a blind eye to the cheating the remainder have to do in order to keep their jobs (the last time this happened, those unrealistic sales-targets and brutal firings put Wells into so much trouble it needed a $36 billion taxpayer-funded bailout). Since at least 2011, Wells Fargo had been warned of the fraud by whistleblowers, who were illegally fired for coming forward. But despite the culture of criminality and the shoot-the-messenger approach to whistleblowing, CEO John Strumpf insists that nothing is wrong with the bank – particularly, that the $200 million he was paid for the bank’s seemingly excellent performance during the fraud is his by rights, because he did nothing wrong (when the bank thrives, it’s because of the CEO’s leadership; when it fails, it’s because of the low-level employees’ moral failures). All this raises an important question. Given that employees were forced into committing fraud in order to make sales targets – and that those who missed those targets lost their jobs – how many of Wells Fargo’s employees were fired for not committing fraud?",0

"(Newbie Justice Neil Gorsuch did not participate in this case.) … In its lawsuits, the city argued that between 2004 and 2012, Wells Fargo and Bank of America pushed risky and more expensive loans on minority customers, even when they were eligible for better terms, which led to extensive loan defaults and foreclosures that left the city with diminished tax revenues and huge bills for cleaning up the mess left behind in blighted neighborhoods. The court needed to determine whether Congress had intended the Fair Housing Act to allow municipalities, or only individuals, to sue in order to combat lending discrimination. The banks counter that the law, which says “any aggrieved person” can sue for violations under the statute, couldn’t possibly have intended that a city would fall into the category of an “aggrieved person.”",0

I have worked at Wells Fargo in the past and in the department that maintains these properties, so I have a much deeper understanding than most Americans about the process, limitations and roadblocks banks face when attempting to maintain these properties. This is how I know that groups such as this are spreading pure propaganda designed to take advantage of people’s lack of knowledge of what’s really going on from the perspective of someone who actually worked at the bank. I should also point out that laws and regulations prevent banks from being able to defend themselves publically about most of the claims being made against them about these situations. Sometimes though, it’s because something happened and they are waiting on an insurance adjuster to inspect the property and if they take action before that time, could affect the insurance filing.",0

They also had to shell out 2 grand for me a couple months ago for another reason I can't delve into and account that with the fact they help me pay for school and rent sometimes the last thing I can bother them about right now is money. My plan was to get the smallest personal loan possible and if that ends up being more than I need to pay I will just pay off the loan with the remainder. If I did it would be though my bank (Wells Fargo) which I know is not the most revered banking company but they essentially have my city taken over so I don't have tons of choice. I also have student loans through them so I don't know how switching would complicate things but I digress. I just need this to be paid for and out of my way so I can focus on my school and everything else I have to pay off hah.,0

"Valles is the first Wells Fargo insider to publicly offer up more details on an issue that surfaced last year in a brief few lines in a regulatory filing by the bank. Wells Fargo disclosed in August that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was looking into whether customers had been harmed by the bank’s practice of freezing and often closing accounts after it or its customers detected signs of fraud. When a bank receives a fraud claim or detects suspicious activity, it typically assigns an investigator to piece together what happened. If the bank determines that customers were innocent victims, it will usually help them try to recover the missing money. But if the bank finds signs that the customer has engaged in illegal activities, like money laundering or fraud, it is supposed to report the issue to law enforcement and close the accounts.",0

It showed immediately in my bank account, and I was able to use some of the money for groceries. The next day, I received an email from my bank (Wells Fargo) saying my account balance was at $0. I checked my bank account, and the $460 he sent me that had been there the day before, was now gone.",0
"Provide the audience with a resolution—an action that shows how the company will fix the problem and prevent it from happening in the future. Wells Fargo is still paying dearly for lost consumer trust after allowing employees to create millions of fake accounts in customers’ names. When it became immediately clear that an apology could never undo the damage, Wells Fargo began a campaign to “make things right,” communicating with customers about eliminating unattainable sales goals and providing settlement expenses. The company still has a long way to go, but in the case of major mistakes like this one, actions speak far louder than words. Curating an authentic brand image doesn’t have to be so hard.",0
